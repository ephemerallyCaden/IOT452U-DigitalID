## Project Context and Scenario

A Digital ID programme has been initiated to support the management and use of digital identities across a federated ecosystem of organisations. The programme requires a backend system that allows a central authority to manage digital identities, while enabling other authorised organisations to make controlled use of identity information.

Within this ecosystem, a central authority (for example, a home or interior ministry) is solely responsible for the creation, update, and status management of Digital IDs. Other organisations, such as tax services, driving licence authorities, welfare services, immigration-related bodies, local authorities, banks, or employers, do not modify identity data. Instead, they interact with the system to verify identities, check identity status, or obtain limited identity information relevant to their needs.

Participating organisations access the Digital ID platform through dedicated portals that are developed and provided by the central authority, with each portal aligned to the role and needs of the organisation using it. Requests from these portals are processed by a shared Digital ID platform. Organisations do not communicate directly with one another.

At the core of the system is Digital ID lifecycle management. The system must support the creation of new identities, updates to permitted identity attributes, and changes to identity status in accordance with defined rules. Certain attributes are immutable, while others may be modified only by the central authority. Each Digital ID has an associated status indicating whether it is currently valid for use, and this status directly affects how the identity may be used by consuming organisations. Operations must be applied deterministically so that each Digital ID remains in a valid and consistent state, including when operations are repeated or conflict with the current status, for example when attempting to update a revoked Digital ID.

For organisations that consume identity information, the system supports a range of identity verification and lookup scenarios. While all organisations interact with the same underlying platform, the information requested and the form of the response may differ depending on organisational needs. Some organisations may require confirmation that a Digital ID exists and is currently valid, while others may need to evaluate additional conditions relevant to their domain.

For example, a tax authority may check that a Digital ID exists, is active, and has not been suspended during a given reporting period before processing a return. A driving licence authority may verify that a Digital ID is active and that any additional eligibility conditions defined for licensing purposes are satisfied before issuing or renewing a licence, for example that the identity is not subject to a temporary restriction. In contrast, an employer or bank may require only a limited verification response indicating whether a Digital ID is currently valid at the time of the request, without access to any additional identity attributes or historical information.

The system applies validation, organisation-level authorisation, and business rules to all incoming requests before performing any operation. Requests that attempt unauthorised actions, violate identity rules, or conflict with the current state of a Digital ID are rejected in a defined and consistent manner. This behaviour must be independent of the number of participating organisations or portals. Key actions such as identity creation, updates, status changes, and verification requests are recorded to allow system behaviour to be examined.

Identity management, including creation, update, and status changes, and identity consumption, including verification and lookup, are treated as distinct system capabilities and must be handled separately by the system.

The project is intended to be implemented as a console-based backend system. There is no requirement for a user interface or web layer. The focus is on system behaviour and structure rather than on user interface concerns or the use of large application frameworks.

## 1. Assessment Overview

This coursework is an individual final assessment for the module. It is intended to reflect the overall learning achieved across the module and to evaluate how learners apply core software engineering practices independently when designing and implementing a backend system.

You will design and develop a software system based on the scenario described above. The emphasis is not on building a large or feature-rich product, but on demonstrating correct system behaviour, clear structure, and sound development practices.

Throughout this assessment, you are expected to apply concepts developed during the module, including software architecture, code organisation, automated testing, version control, and clear technical communication. As no separate technical report is required, the code itself should clearly express system structure, behaviour, and design decisions through readable and well-organised implementation.

The system does not need to be large or complex. A smaller system is acceptable provided it demonstrates sufficient behaviour, is clearly structured, and shows evidence of organised development.

You must implement your system in either Python or Java.

This assessment is intended to help you:

- demonstrate independent application of software engineering practices
- produce clear and readable code structure
- show organised development through version control
- demonstrate readiness for more advanced software engineering work

## 2. Project Requirements

### A. Development Approach and Version Control

- Git must be used for version control throughout the project.
- The repository should show meaningful commit activity reflecting incremental development.
- Development progress should be visible through commit history and task tracking or user stories.
- Version control is expected to support organised development rather than act as a final upload mechanism.

### B. Testing and Automation

- Unit tests must be implemented using a testing framework such as JUnit.
- Tests should verify core system behaviour by covering selected functionality of the system.
- Continuous integration should be used to automatically build the project and run tests, supporting reliable and repeatable verification.
- Testing in this assessment is intended to demonstrate understanding of verification and reliability rather than exhaustive test coverage or advanced testing techniques.

## 3. Deliverables

You will submit two deliverables.

### 1. Video Demonstration

A recorded video demonstrating the system and explaining your work.

The video should:
- show the system’s behaviour clearly
- explain how the system is structured
- demonstrate key technical decisions
- reflect a clear and professional standard of technical communication

The video must be no longer than 10 minutes. There is no minimum length, but it must be sufficient to clearly demonstrate system behaviour and explain the implementation.

### 2. Zipped Source Code

You must submit a ZIP file containing:

- the complete source code of the project
- a README file

The README should include:

- the GitHub repository link
- brief instructions for running the system
- a short overview of system structure and main components

The code should be readable, clearly structured, and consistent with what is shown in the video. As no separate technical document is required, clarity and readability of the code form an important part of the submission.

## 4. Marking Scheme

The coursework is marked out of 100 marks, distributed as follows:

- Product Functionality and Demonstrated Behaviour – 25 marks
- Software Design and Code Quality – 25 marks
- Testing and Continuous Integration – 20 marks
- Version Control and Development Evidence – 15 marks
- Technical Communication and Demonstration Clarity – 15 marks

## 5. Submission Requirements

The video must be submitted using QMplus Media (https://media.qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/). There will be a separate submission area for video submissions. Further information will be provided in the video submission area on QMplus.

All source code must be submitted as a single ZIP file. The submitted code must match the system demonstrated in the video.

The ZIP file must include the complete project repository and a README file containing:

- the GitHub repository link
- instructions for running the system
- a brief overview of the system structure and main components

The submission should be self-contained and must not rely on external resources other than the GitHub repository link. Any linked resources must be publicly accessible. Resources that cannot be accessed will not be considered during marking.

## 6. Generative AI

The use of generative AI tools for coding purposes is not permitted for this assessment. This includes, but is not limited to, tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar systems used to generate source code.

The use of generative AI to produce text or explanations that are submitted as your own work is also not permitted and constitutes academic misconduct. As this assessment does not require a separate written report, any explanatory content included in the README or video demonstration must reflect your own understanding and work.

Spelling and grammar assistive tools may be used, provided they do not generate, rewrite, or substantially alter technical content.

You should not rely on generative AI tools to generate references or technical explanations, as such tools may produce inaccurate or fabricated information, which undermines the credibility of your work.

If you are unsure whether the use of a particular tool or feature is appropriate, you should discuss this with the module organiser in advance.

## 7. Late Submissions and Extenuating Circumstances

Assessments submitted after the published deadline will be marked as late and will receive a penalty, unless you have approved Extenuating Circumstances (EC).

You may submit up to seven calendar days after the deadline, but a penalty of 5% of the total marks available will be applied to the assessment for each 24-hour period (or part of it) that the work is late (e.g., five marks deducted each day from a total of 100).

After seven calendar days, the assessment will be recorded as a non-submission and given a mark of zero.

For more information, you can find the latest Assessment Handbook and Extenuating Circumstances policy via the QMUL policies page: https://www.qmul.ac.uk/governance-and-legal-services/policy/policies-by-category/.
